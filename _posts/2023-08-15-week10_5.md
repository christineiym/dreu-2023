## Starting Off
Before and after our lab meeting, I got the chance to explore the CS buildings with my labmates as we mapped the buildings for relevant environment features (both for information for AccessMap/GTFS and for my research back at UNC). Dr. Caspi treated us to lunch and I expressed how thankful I was to have worked with them this summer, especially with Dr. Caspi.

## Writing
I'm now frantically finishing my paper and finishing off my remaining food while packing to leave tomorrow, and will have a last-minute meeting to connect with a fellow REU student!
