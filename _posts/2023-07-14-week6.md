## Starting Off
This was my second week in Seattle, full of research and wonder!

## Literature Review
Upon advice from Dr. Caspi, I paused my literature review at the 100th article reviewed from the first screening (~60 removing the ones I eventually omitted altogether due to irrelevance or not finding the full text) and began making a taxonomy. While I have yet to find a good library to implement for fuzzy matching of terms, and thus am still reviewing the raw text semi-manually to ensure no terms are missed, I decided to make a tool that allows for modeling of relationships between terms while automatically associating terms/relationships with the article(s) under examination. I really should learn more about NLP so that I can automate the entire process instead. Regardless, Dr. Caspi suggested that I use ChatGPT (haha! an actual professor-recommended use case!) to do the work of fuzzy matching new terms to the existing taxonomy. It makes mistakes, but as I am correcting it regardless, it is surprisingly helpful.
