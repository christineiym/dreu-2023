## Starting Off
For the third week of my REU, Dr. Caspi had to do some things overseas, so we had prepared me beforehand with a lot of literature to review.

## Writing...and Reading!
As I wrote about transportation equity, I realized that, while I do work from an outline, I have a tendency to obsess over paragraphs unecessarily, which causes me to take a much longer time in formal writing than I should. I am still working on applying the advice from my UNC research advisor and others: to iteratively improve on writing to flesh it out. 

Unfortunately me asking Dr. Bishop about quoting him on the visit to the architecture school got lost in an email, but it was essentially about considering what people consider when designing a school.

On Tuesday afternoon, I paused my writing and associated thinking to begin a rapid 'systematic' review on built environment features that are especially important in a map useful for those with and without disabilities. (I put 'rapid' in quotes because I read that actual systematic reviews actually require more than 1 person and take months on average, so the correct term here may simply be rapid review). I ended up getting 1200 articles after refining my query and am screening them for relevance; I finished the week on article #898. Onwards!
