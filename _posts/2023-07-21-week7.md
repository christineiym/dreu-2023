## Starting Off
This week actually started with leading the lab meeting and presenting my work from UNC to connect to the Transportation Data Equity Initiative! Everyone was quite interested in seeing the external work and we discussed how one of the data specifications we're involved in (GTFS pathways, an indoor routing specification for transit) can be adapted for the indoor routing portion. Dr. Caspi was also curious about my experience with getting support from administration (which has more to do with my involvement in general advocacy work than me actually reaching out to administrators, as I probably would have waited until a completely open-source version was deployed, by which time some connections could perhaps have been missed out on; reflecting on it, I realize that everything really is God's grace).

## The Rest of the Week
For the rest of the week, I continued my analysis of articles. I felt bad about how long the literature review was taking me, but Dr. Caspi pointed out that literature reviews tend to take a long time.

## Exploring Seattle
Besides researching and cooking, I got to explore Seattle a bit more, taking a UNC acquiantance around UW and going with my former fourth-grade teacher took me to see the Space Needle!
